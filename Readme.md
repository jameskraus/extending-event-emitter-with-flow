# Extending Event Emitter with Flow Types

This repo serves as an answer to a [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49411515/limiting-the-type-of-eventname-in-a-class-that-extends-eventemitter-with-flow) on how to extend
EventEmitter and still let Flow know what kind of arguments were passed
to the event emitter.

Original question:

>As an example, let's say I have a class that only emits three possible events – `'pending'` or `'success'` or `'failure'`. Additionally, the type of the argument received in the `eventHandler` depends on which event was emitted –
>
>* if `'pending'`, the `eventHandler` receives no argument
>* if `'success'`, the `eventHandler` receives a `number`
>* if `'failure'`, the `eventHandler` receives an `Error`
>
>Here is how I tried to model that:
>
>    // @flow
>
>    import EventEmitter from 'events'
>
>    type CustomEventObj = {|
>      pending: void,
>      success: number,
>      error: Error
>    |}
>
>    declare class MyEventEmitter extends EventEmitter {
>      on<K: $Keys<CustomEventObj>>(
>        eventName: K,
>        eventHandler: (
>          e: $ElementType<CustomEventObj, K>,
>          ...args: Array<any>
>        ) => void
>      ): this
>    }
>
